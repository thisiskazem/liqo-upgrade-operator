# Target descriptors are dynamically generated from Liqo Helm charts
# during the validation phase (Step 5.5) based on:
#   - Current version (detected from liqo-controller-manager image tag)
#   - Target version (from LiqoUpgrade.spec.targetVersion)
#
# The generator Job fetches the Liqo Helm chart for each version,
# renders it with `helm template`, and parses the output to create
# accurate component descriptors with correct args and env vars.
